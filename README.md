# Html-Parser

I have developed a Python program called bucourses.py that crawls Bogazici Universityâ€™s OBIKAS registration pages and extract course offering information. The date range might start from 1998-Fall term and can go up to 2019-Summer term. After the extraction of the data in a given date range, the output is displayed into the standard output in CSV format.
We ran the program with the following command example: python bucourses.py 2019-Spring 2019-Summer
